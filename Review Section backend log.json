Also only 2 tea bags at coffee station. Attitude of desk was \"We don't care\". A\/C units (we had 2 rooms) made loud noise that sounds like a truck reverse warning each cycle. Woke us up every cycle time, both rooms. Reported to desk in AM, manager? said \" we'll check on it\". Nothing else, never looked up from desk top. Breakfast not up to standards of other nearby motels in same area. We stayed at this motel for location. Would not stay here again even if best price which it was not. Very disappointed in the service."
